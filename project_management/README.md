##Project Management
Just like our dev efforts, everything is in [constant flux to best serve our clients](http://webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/responsive-discovery/) around here. Many of us adore  [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/) or [Trello](https://trello.com/). And we make [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/) work when needed. :) 

We dig using the right tools for each project, which often includes [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) (for project updates, discussions, and file sharing) and [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) (for design collaboration).

When choosing tools to help our teams collaborate around work, we use the following principles as our guide:

1. Be simple
2. Be accessible
3. Efficiently surface remaining work

###Organization
To help counter the confusion that comes with using numerous tools and repositories for large projects, we find it's helpful to create a [Project Hub (centralized repository of project information)](https://github.com/sparkbox/standard/blob/master/project_management/base-hub.md). This helps everyone access exactly what they need when they need it and can help as teammembers join the project.

_Project Hubs help consolidate all the pertenent high-level project details in one spot._

###Priorities
No matter the tools, we aim to keep projects focused on goals, priorities, and removing barriers for the people doing the work and making decisions. We most often use [GitHub](https://github.com) to create user stories or other work that needs done as "Issues" to gather and communicate the scope of work that needs done in detail. We'll often use Zenhub to then provide estimates for the level of effort for those issues and to prioritize those same issues.

_Kanban boards allow you to prioritize work to stay in ultimate control over the work that gets done and when it is done. It's a great way to view priorities and work iteratively._

###Communication & Control
We estimate work early and do at least weekly transparent reality checks of budgets, timelines, and project health. We share those reality checks (typically via Basecamp with the whole team) and keep you on top of where things stand so that you can make smart decisions throughout the project. Using Zenhub and other kanban boards, while working hourly and giving frequent updates gives you ultimate control over proiritization and how your budget is spent.

_Burndowns give a great visual view of project health._

We like to work in iterations, and can use your priorities to create appropriate milestonesâ€”and when we match up those issues with estimates, and milestones for a project, we get the power of burndown charts. We use all of these resources and tools to keep you updated on checkins/standup calls and walk through work/progress together. We get to a testing environment early to not only _tell_ you the progress we've made, but actually show you and anyone else you want to see, the reality of where the project stands early and often.

### People
Drew, Emily, and Melissa are our main project managers. They plan things, keep us on task, scope hours, and so much more. And Austin asissts project managers as a project coordinator.
