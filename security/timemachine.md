# Time Machine Backup Disk Encryption
Time Machine Backups contain a working image of your computer at the time the
backup was taken. For this reason, encrypting these backups is important.

## First-Time Setup

If you are not currently backing up the machine, follow the [Apple provided instructions](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18852?locale=en_US) for setting up encrypted Time Machine backups to an external disk.

## Capturing Status
Per the Sparkbox security policy, we regulary capture and record employees'
status for each security policy item.

1. Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Time Machine.
2. Click Select Disk or Add or Remove Backup Disk (if you have multiple backup
   disks).
3. Capture a [screen shot][iOS Screenshot] which includes the status of all
   Backup Disks.

Your disk should show _Encrypted_ under the name and after the disk size. If not, follow the instructions provided below.

## Switching from Unencrypted to Encrypted

If you previously set up Time Machine, but the steps for [Capturing Status][#capturing-status]
show that disk is _not_ encrypted, follow these Apple provided instructions for
[changing from unencrypted to encrypted](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-time-machine-backup-disk-secure-mh21241/mac)
