=================

[![Image of Expression Engine][producti]][product]

Expression Engine is a PHP CMS.

Best Practices
--------------

* Don't use the structure_entries plug-in.
* Favor Pixel and Tonic plug-ins.
* Don't spend longer writing a new plug-in when one can be purchased.
* When more than just a few pages use Structure for site organization.
* Check each page type in debug mode and look at the number of queries and the page size. Anything over 125 queries and 10 MB should be cause for concern.
